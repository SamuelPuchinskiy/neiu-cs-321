    <h4>Homework 1</h4>
    <ol>
      <!--Application Name: Pick a name for your server-side application!-->
      <li>My application name will be called <i>The Astrology App</i>.</li>
      <!--Project Topic/Objective: In 5-10 sentences, describe the objective of your web application. What is it? What will it do? As you write this, remember that all code written for the homework and the project must be your own work and cannot have been developed for a previous course or project.-->
      <li>The Astrology App will calculate the client’s complete astrological chart. For instance, this app will ask for the user’s complete Birthdate, the year, month, and day. Then the data will be saved into a database and output their complete astrology. The application will calculate the user’s Horoscope sign, Animal Sign, Numerology. In addition, the application gives a yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily Horoscope for each zodiac sign. The application in the future will also be able to calculate a person’s Moon sign and Rising Sign.</li>
      <!--Motivation: In 5-10 sentences, describe why this project topic is of interest to you. Aside from the fact that this project is a required component for the course, why do you want to build this particular application?-->
      <li>For me, Astrology is fun to read and learn about. There is much to explore the many aspects of Astrology. I do not necessarily believe in Astrology; hence, it is mainly the Barnum Effect and/or the Self Fulfilling Prophecy. However, it is very entertaining to read about. In addition Astrology may increase a person’s awareness. I believe motivation is something that comes from intrinsic value and from within. I want to build this particular application because Astrology is something that I am very interested in and creating this application will be something that I am very passionate about.</li>
      <!--Server-Side Components: What aspects of the application will be related to storing user information or data in a database?-->
      <li>The Astrology application will store the user’s Birthdate and their complete astrological chart once they create their profile. In addition, I may add a login and password, so a user does not need to always put their Birthdate information repeatedly to get their astrological chart. I will also have a component that will allow a user to edit their profile information as well as their birth chart.</li>
