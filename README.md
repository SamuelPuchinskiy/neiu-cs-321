    <h4>Homework 1</h4>
    <ol>
      <!--Application Name: Pick a name for your server-side application!-->
      <li>The application name is called <i>The Astrology App</i>.</li>
      <!--Project Topic/Objective: In 5-10 sentences, describe the objective of your web application. What is it? What will it do? As you write this, remember that all code written for the homework and the project must be your own work and cannot have been developed for a previous course or project.-->
      <li>The Astrology App calculates the client’s complete astrological chart. The app asks for the user’s complete birthdate, the year, month, and day. Then the application saves the birthday data into the database and outputs their complete astrology. The application calculates the user’s Zodiac sign, Animal Sign, and Numerology. In addition, the application gives a yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily horoscope for each zodiac sign. The horoscope content comes from an API by Tapasweni Pathak.  The application in the future will also be able to calculate a person’s Moon sign and Rising Sign.</li>
      <!--Motivation: In 5-10 sentences, describe why this project topic is of interest to you. Aside from the fact that this project is a required component for the course, why do you want to build this particular application?-->
      <li>For me, Astrology is fun to read and learn about. There is so much to explore in Astrology. Astrology has many aspects to it. I do not necessarily believe in Astrology because I think it is mainly the Barnum Effect and/or the Self Fulfilling Prophecy. However, it is very entertaining to read about. I also believe that learning about one person’s astrology will increase their awareness and motivation. I believe motivation is something that comes from intrinsic value and from within. I want to build this particular application because Astrology is something that I am very interested in and creating this application will be something that I am very passionate about.</li>
      <!--Server-Side Components: What aspects of the application will be related to storing user information or data in a database?-->
      <li>Once the user creates a profile, they are able to calculate as many Astrology charts as they wish. By having a profile, the user does not need to always put their birthdate information repeatedly to get their astrological chart. The user is also able to edit their own user profile. In addition, the user is able to read all twelve zodiac signs, and their yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily Horoscopes.</li>
